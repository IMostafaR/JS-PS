# Sync & async

## what is the output of this code with explanation?

```js
function main() {
  console.log("A");
  setTimeout(function print() {
    console.log("B");
  }, 0);
  console.log("C");
}
main();
```

### Answer

The output of both statements is:

```js
// A
// C
// B
```

### Thinking:

**Background**

1. There are two types of processes that occur in `JavaScript`: `synchronous` processes and `asynchronous` processes.
2. A `synchronous` process means that the `JavaScript engine` executes the code line by line instantly without any delay when it is `called`.
3. The `main` function and its code block, except the `setTimeout` function, are considered `synchronous` functions.
4. An `asynchronous` process means that the code does not execute instantly; instead, there will be an unknown delay.
5. The `setTimeout` function is considered a `web API` event as part of `asynchronous` JavaScript operations.
6. `Web API` events execute a `callback` function when an `asynchronous` operation completes.
7. To handle these processes, the `JavaScript engine` has four main components: the `call stack`, `web API`, `callback queue`, and `event loop`.
8. All `synchronous` code goes into the `call stack` to be executed line by line, and the executed code is removed from the `call stack`.
9. If the `call stack` encounters `asynchronous` code, it is moved to the `web API`. When the `asynchronous` process is completed, the `callback` function is moved to the `callback queue`.
10. The `callback queue` follows the concept of `first-in, first-out` when dealing with all `callback` functions inside.
11. The `event loop` keeps track of both the `call stack` and the `callback queue`. When all `synchronous` code is executed and the `call stack` is empty, the `event loop` looks for the first `callback` function in the `queue` and moves it to the `call stack`.

**Explanation**

1. When the `main` function is called, it goes into the `call stack`, followed by `console.log("A")`.
2. The `setTimeout` function enters the `call stack` and is then moved directly to the `web API`, waiting for the `asynchronous` process to be completed. Since the `setTimeout` time is set to `0`, the `print()` function is moved to the `callback queue`.
3. `console.log("C")` enters the `call stack` to be executed.
4. The `event loop` checks if the `call stack` is empty, then it moves the `print()` function from the `callback queue` to the `call stack` to be executed, and the code `console.log("B")` is executed.
