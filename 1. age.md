# Age in days

## Create a function that takes the age in years and returns the age in days.

### Answer

```js
let ageInDays = (ageInYears) => ageInYears * 365 + ageInYears / 4;

ageInDays(30); // 10957.5
```

### Thinking:

1. Define a `function` called `ageInDays` that takes `ageInYears` as a `parameter`.
2. Multiply `ageInYears` by `365` to calculate the number of days.
3. Divide `ageInYears` by `4` to calculate the number of leap years.
4. `Add` the calculated number of days and `leap years` together to get the total number of days.
5. `Return` the total number of days as the result.
