# Hoisting dilemma

## what is the output of this code with explanation

```js
function sayHi() {
  console.log(name);
  console.log(age);
  var name = "Ayush";
  let age = 21;
}
sayHi();
```

### Answer

The output is:

```js
console.log(name); // undefined
console.log(age); // Uncaught ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'age' before initialization
```

### Thinking:

**Background**

1. There are two distinct concepts in `JavaScript`: `Hoisting` and `Temporal Dead Zone` (TDZ).
2. Regardless of where variables are declared, they are hoisted to the top of their `existing scope`. This applies to all three keywords: `var`, `let`, and `const`.
3. The `Temporal Dead Zone` is a zone in which declared variables cannot be accessed without initializing them with initial values.
4. The `var` keyword behaves differently than `let` and `const`. When a variable is declared with `var` (and then hoisted), `JavaScript` assigns it the initial value `undefined` immediately, causing the `TDZ` of the variable to be initiated and terminated instantly. This behavior does not apply to `let` and `const` in order to detect errors where variables are accessed before they are assigned a value. Therefore, variables declared with `let` and `const` remain in the `TDZ` until they are given an initial value.

**Explanation**

1. All variables in the `sayHi` function are `hoisted` to the top of its code block.
2. The `console.log(name)` statement can see the variable `name` declared with the `var` keyword and access its initial value `undefined`.
3. The `console.log(age)` statement can see the variable `age` declared with `let` keyword, but it tries to access it within the `TDZ`, resulting in a reference error.
