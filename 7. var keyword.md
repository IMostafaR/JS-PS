# Var Keyword

## what is the output of this code with explanation

```js
var num = 8;
var num = 10;
console.log(num);
```

### Answer

The output is:

```js
// 10
```

### Thinking:

1. In `JavaScript`, `var` is a keyword used for variable deceleration.
2. The behavior of `var` allows the same variable name to be used for re-deceleration of a new variable.
3. The first line declares a variable `num` and assigns it to the initial value `8`.
4. The second line declares a new variable with the same name `num` and assigns it to the value `10`.
5. The second declaration of `num` overwrites the first value, and the `console.log(num)` statement can only access the new value `10`.
