# Average

## Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the average of this numbers.

### Answer

```js
let calcAverage = (arr) =>
  arr.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0) / arr.length;

calcAverage([10, 20, 30, 40]); // 25
```

### Thinking:

1. Define a `function` called `calcAverage` that takes an array `arr` as a `parameter`.
2. Use the `reduce` method on the array to calculate the `sum` of all the elements. Start with an initial value of `0`.
3. Divide the `sum` by the `length` of the array to calculate the average.
4. `Return` the calculated average.
