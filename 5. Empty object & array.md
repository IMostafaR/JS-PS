# Equality of reference data type

## what is the output of:

```js
console.log([] == []);
console.log({} == {});
```

## And explain your answer

### Answer

The output of both statements is `false`

### Thinking:

1. Both array `[]` and object `{}` are of the data type `object`.
2. In `JavaScript`, the data type `object` is considered a `reference` type.
3. `Reference` types mean that each `[]` or `{}` is stored in a different `memory location` with different `references`.
4. `Reference` types are not compared based on their values, but rather based on their `references`. Therefore, `[] == []` and `{} == {}` will always result in `false`, even if they may appear to have the same structure and values.
5. Additionally, using the `strict equality` operator `===` will also result in `false` for the same reasons mentioned above.
